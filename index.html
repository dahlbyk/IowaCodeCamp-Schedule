        <h2>You Can Do What in Windows Azure?!</h2>
        <p>You already know you can run your .NET based web sites, service, and applications on Windows Azure, but this only scratches the surface of what you can do. Encoding video with Expression Encoder, hosting adaptive streaming video in blob storage, hosting multiple web sites, enabling remote desktop, creating a VPN and more are all possible with the Windows Azure platform. In this session demo intensive session I'll show you how to do these things and more to unleash the power of Azure.</p>

        <h2>Using Html5 Today</h2>
        <p>Html5 is the latest buzzword around the web and with the latest release of browsers more and more is possible than ever before.  In this session we'll demystify the buzz around Html5, look at why it's important, and what you can do today to utilize it in your web development projects.  This session focuses primarily on client side coding practices such as Html5, CSS3, and JavaScript and assumes some understanding of working with such.</p>

        <h2>Application Modeling in VS2010</h2>
        <p>In this session, we'll look at using the modeling tools in Visual Studio 2010 to help design an application. This will include use cases, sequence diagrams, and class diagrams. The focus will be on real world, get your job done tasks rather than academically perfect UML. We'll also look at how to use the modeling tools to quickly analyze brownfield code.</p>

        <h2>I didn't know you could do that - .Net Tips and Tricks</h2>
        <p>Visual Studio took over 43 MILLION lines of code to write – it's big. Really BIG. There is no way that a single developer can know everything about Visual Studio that will be useful. That's where this session comes in. We'll cover a plethora of shortcuts, strategies, hidden features and freeware that will save you a gigantic amount time when developing your .Net application with Visual Studio. Beginners and advanced programmers alike will walk away saying, "I didn't know you could to that!"</p>

        <h2>LINQ to Objects - Practical examples</h2>
        <p>Over the last few years, many developers have begun to embrace the use of LINQ to Objects within their code.  I've heard developers describe the technology as "game changing" and personally know many who would not go back to pre-LINQ versions of .NET for any amount of money.</p>
        <p>This talk will focus on practical uses of LINQ to Objects to demonstrate how to filter, aggregate and transform lists of objects.  It will demonstrate how to create very concise yet still very readable code using LINQ to Objects focusing on problems developers face nearly every day.</p>
        <p>No previous knowledge of LINQ to Objects is required.  However, some familiarity with Lambda expressions would be helpful (but again, not necessarily required).</p>

        <h2>Developing with Objective-C 2.0 for Mac OS X and iPhone OS</h2>
        <p>Ever wondered how to develop for the iPhone and Mac OS X platform? This area is getting attention with the advent of the iOS and Mac Application stores. We’ll take an in-depth look at the Mac OS X / iPhone OS development platform - what you need to get started, the available resources and references and why you should jump in now. We’ll be exploring about the Objective-C 2.0 programming language and the Cocoa platform (Mac OS X) / Cocoa Touch (iPhone OS) and look at the IDE - XCode, and the application libraries that come with Mac OS X and iPhone OS. Finally, we’ll touch on why the Mac is also a great platform for developing applications in a myriad of scripting and other languages, as well as provide online and publication resources.</p>

        <p>My background is Computer Sciences with interests in Software Engineering, Human Computer Interaction and Mac OS X / iPhone OS  development. I started programming with BASIC in 1978 on an Apple ][ and have over 30 years of experience in the field. I worked on OPENSTEP (precursor to Mac OS X Cocoa) graphical prototyping applications initially when I joined Rockwell Collins in 1999. My role as a Principal Systems Engineer in the Advanced Concepts Group permits me to interact with fellow engineers in the company, direct projects, as well as run a lab environment for advanced prototyping for aircraft flight decks. Prior to joining Rockwell Collins I worked at Acuity (formerly ichat) developing interactive user interfaces for live chat customer service agents. I have been awarded seven US patents and have been recognised within the company and outside for my contributions to engineering. In my remaining spare time (infinite of course!) I try to work on my blog, develop Mac OS X and iPhone OS applications. I’m really motivated to share my experience to help fellow software practitioners develop better skills - be that in good design, implementation or computer science fundamentals.</p>

        <h2>Get your hands on Haskell</h2>
        <p>Scala was my gateway drug to Haskell but C# should have been.  It turns out that Haskell has been a highly influential force in languages such as C# and Scala (and others to be sure).  Microsoft employs many of the worlds best Haskell minds (see Simon Peyton Jones, Erik Meijer), and a lot of ideas from Haskell have bled through .NET languages and libraries.</p>
        <p>In this session we will do a short introduction to the language do some simple exercises and then we'll write a basic Haskell program, from scratch, using intermediate functional programming techniques (higher order functions, combinators, etc).</p>

        <p>NoSQL: "Non-relational, distributed, schema-free, easy replication support, massive data sets, and horizontal scalable" - It's not just another trendy buzzword; modern applications benefit from and are increasingly requiring these characteristics. This session will introduce what NoSQL is, how it differs from traditional RDBMS, and CouchDB, a NoSQL document store which is used by the likes of CERN, BBC, Zynga, WWF, Meebo, and many more. We'll dive into CouchDB's RESTful API, map/reduce, and real world examples, ranging from data warehousing, to creating a user system, and you'll see how it easy it is to start taking advantage of NoSQL!</p>

        <h2>Pushing the Web Around</h2>
        <p>Web 2.0 and CRUD-based web apps are dying.  Users expect to receive updated data as soon as it happens without reloading pages. Companies like Facebook, Twitter and Meetup are all rolling out new technology for streaming content down to their users, which enables compelling new products. Together we’ll explore this trend towards the push-based, real-time web in general and look at a concrete approach to developing apps and APIs. An example application that streams relevant location-based data to mobile browsers will demonstrate our approach. In this session, expect to learn about Comet, long polling, streaming APIs, event-driven architecture and WebSockets using Lift, ZeroMQ, Akka, and other technologies.</p>

        <p>We're all object-oriented programmers, and most of us know the basics of OOP design - encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance, abstraction, etc..., but fewer of us know the advanced techniques and patterns.  In this talk, we'll go over some of these advanced OOP concepts - including a set of ideas known as the SOLID principles.  We'll review the basics of OOP, then dive in to the deep end and learn the next-level tricks of the trade.</p>

        <h2>OData - The Future of Web Services</h2>
        <p>The Open Data Protocol (OData) is a web protocol for querying and updating data.  It standardizes web service APIs by allowing clients to access the entire set of data exposed by a web service endpoint by using a standard query language that uses REST-like URIs and HTTP methods.  There is no need to read through web service API documentation; you decide what data you need and query for it directly.</p>
        <p>This talk will be an overview of WCF Data Services; a .NET web service implementation that utilizes the protocol.  We’ll start with the basics of OData itself and move into setting up a WCF Data Service endpoint and what is made possible by building on top of it.  We’ll show the power of OData by utilizing tools like Excel 2010 PowerPivot and the Silverlight OData Explorer.</p>
